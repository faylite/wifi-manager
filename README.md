# Wifi Manager
A wifi manager for Windows created in C#
Since Windows 8 and later Microsoft removed the ability to export the network profiles to a usb drive
and import it on other computers.
This program provides a nice GUI alternative to using netsh commands in the command line.
The progam is designed to run from a usb drive and is portable, so you can carry it around and
add/export profiles to new computers with ease.

####WARNING
This application currently stores your network passwords in clear text,
remember to keep your usb drive safe and delete the data when you aren't going to use it

####Download
Downloads can be found on dropbox for now, the releases will probably be moved in the future. And I can't
guarantee it will contain the latest build, I recommend building it yourself.
